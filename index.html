        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <div class="para">
          <p>
            I am a passionate and driven individual with a robust educational
            background that spans commerce and computer science. My academic
            journey began at Brahmrishi Mission School in Abohar, where I
            completed my 10th class in 2018. This institution, affiliated with
            the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), provided me with a
            comprehensive education, nurturing my interest in various subjects,
            especially in science and mathematics. The rigorous curriculum and
            dedicated faculty at Brahmrishi Mission School helped me develop
            strong analytical and problem-solving skills, which have been
            invaluable in my subsequent studies and professional endeavors.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            2020, I graduated from Dayanand Anglo Vedic Collegiate in Abohar
            after completing my 12th class under the Punjab School Education
            Board (PSEB), specializing in commerce. The diverse and challenging
            coursework in commerce, including subjects like accountancy,
            business studies, and economics, provided me with a solid foundation
            in business principles and financial management. This period was
            instrumental in shaping my decision to pursue a career that combines
            business acumen with technological expertise, as I gained insights
            into economic principles and business strategies.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Following my higher secondary education, I enrolled in the Bachelor
            of Computer Applications (BCA) program at D.A.V College in Abohar,
            affiliated with Panjab University. I graduated in 2023, having
            acquired a comprehensive understanding of computer applications and
            software development. The BCA program provided a well-rounded
            curriculum, covering subjects such as programming languages,
            database management, networking, and web development. This diverse
            education ensured I was well-prepared to tackle the challenges of
            the tech industry. During my time at D.A.V College, I actively
            engaged in various projects and internships, allowing me to apply my
            theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios and gain valuable
            industry experience.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            To further enhance my skills and stay abreast of the latest industry
            trends, I pursued several online courses. In July 2023, I completed
            a course in HTML & CSS on Udemy. This course offered an in-depth
            understanding of web design principles, enabling me to create
            responsive and visually appealing web pages. The hands-on projects
            and assignments in this course allowed me to develop practical
            skills that are essential for a successful career in web
            development.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Building on this foundation, I completed a JavaScript course on
            Udemy in November 2023. JavaScript is a crucial programming language
            in web development, used for creating dynamic and interactive
            websites. The course covered various aspects of JavaScript,
            including DOM manipulation, event handling, and AJAX. By the end of
            the course, I had developed several interactive web applications,
            significantly boosting my confidence and proficiency in JavaScript.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            My educational background and additional certifications have
            equipped me with a solid foundation in web development and
            programming. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and
            possess a good understanding of other technologies and frameworks.
            My passion for continuous learning drives me to seek opportunities
            to enhance my skills and knowledge constantly.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In summary, my journey from Brahmrishi Mission School to D.A.V
            College, along with my additional certifications, has prepared me
            well for a successful career in the tech industry. I am eager to
            apply my skills and knowledge to meaningful projects and continue
            growing as a professional in the field of web development and
            software engineering.
